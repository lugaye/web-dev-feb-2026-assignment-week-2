# 📝 Week 2: The Event Sign-Up Page
"Making the Web Interactive"
Welcome to Week 2! Last week, you built a static card. This week, you’re building an Event Registration Page. Think of this as the gatekeeper for a concert, a tech conference, or a secret underground club.

You will learn how to build a Form—the most powerful tool in a web developer's arsenal for collecting user data.

## 🎯 The Mission Objective
Create a registration page for a fictional event (e.g., "The Galactic Coding Summit 2026").

### 🏗️ Requirements (The "Must-Haves")
To pass the automated grader, your index.html must include:

Semantic Containers: Use <header>, <main>, and <footer> to wrap your content.

The Form Element: A <form> tag that contains all your inputs.

Required Email Input: An <input> with type="email" that has the required attribute.

T-Shirt Selection: A <select> dropdown menu containing at least 3 sizes (S, M, L).

Multi-line Comments: A <textarea> where users can write their "dietary requirements."

The Submit Button: A <button> with type="submit" to finalize the registration.

### 🛠️ Step-by-Step Instructions
#### Step 1: Sync Your Repo
Just like last week, click the invitation link on the LMS. Once your repo is ready, pull it to your local machine.

#### Step 2: Structure with Meaning
Don't just throw tags on the page. Use Semantic HTML.

Why? It tells search engines and screen readers what your content is, not just how it looks.

#### Step 3: Labels are Life
Every input needs a <label>. Use the for attribute on the label to match the id of the input.

Example: `<label for="email">Email:</label> <input id="email" type="email">`

#### Step 4: Validate and Push
Once you think you've nailed it:

Save and open in your browser to test.

git add ., git commit -m "Form complete", and git push origin main.

Check the Actions tab on GitHub for that sweet green checkmark.
